## 🚨 Potential Data Leakage Investigation

### Why `total_distance_km` Dominates (85.64% importance)?

**Potential Concerns:**
1. **Perfect Linear Relationship**: Consumption may be almost perfectly correlated with distance
2. **Feature Engineering Issue**: Other features may be derived from distance
3. **Domain Logic**: In EVs, distance is indeed the primary consumption driver

**Evidence Supporting Legitimacy:**
- High correlation with target (0.975) is expected for EVs
- Physics-based relationship: Energy = Distance × Efficiency
- Other important features (battery, temperature) make sense

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Likely legitimate** but monitor for real-world performance
